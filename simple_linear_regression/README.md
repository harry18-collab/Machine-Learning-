# Simple Linear Regression (Height vs Weight)

## Practice Summary
Implemented and practiced Simple Linear Regression on the Height–Weight dataset using both Gradient Descent and
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to understand how model parameters are estimated.

## Dataset
- Name: Height–Weight Dataset  
- **Description:** Predicting weight based on height using simple linear regression.

##  Implementation
- Built Simple Linear Regression model
- Implemented parameter estimation using **OLS (closed-form solution)**
- (Optional) Compared with Gradient Descent approach
- Visualized data points and regression line
- Trained model and made predictions
- Evaluated basic error (e.g., MSE)


## 🧠 Learnings
- Difference between OLS (analytical solution) and **Gradient Descent (iterative optimization)**
- Understanding slope(m) and intercept(c)
- Loss function (MSE) and how OLS minimizes it
- Importance of data visualization in regression
